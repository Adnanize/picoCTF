## Solution 

First we have to use "wget" tool to download the relevant files from the picoCTF website as it shown.

The resulted file after downloading is zipped, therefore, we have to unzip the file by using "unzip" and we have the resulted directory "home"

After accessing it the path, we have the following game file "guessing_game.sh", to launch this we use "bash guessing_game.sh"

As you can see, we are prompted to pick a number between 1 to 1000 and you are suppose to guess the number.

**Catch**: You only have 10 guess!!!

Yes I know for some reason the flag isn't showing but the soultion is correct lmaoðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

## Explanation 
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted range by repeatedly dividing the range in half. Hereâ€™s how it works in the context of guessing a number between 1 and 1000 within 10 tries:

* Start by guessing the middle number between 1 and 1000 (which is 500).
* Get feedback: If the number is higher, focus on the upper half (501â€“1000). If it's lower, focus on the lower half (1â€“499).
* Pick the middle of your new range based on the feedback and guess again.
* Repeat this process: each time, cut your range in half by guessing the middle of the remaining numbers.
* Continue narrowing down until you find the exact number or reach 10 tries.

**By halving each time, you'll find the number in 10 guesses or fewer!**

So, in our instance, we had the following:

* Start with 500 (middle of 1 and 1000) â†’ Too high.
* Guess 250 (middle of 1 and 499) â†’ Too high.
* Guess 125 (middle of 1 and 249) â†’ Too low.
* Guess 188 (middle of 126 and 249) â†’ Too low.
* Guess 219 (middle of 189 and 249) â†’ Too high.
* Guess 203 (middle of 189 and 218) â†’ Too low.
* Guess 211 (middle of 204 and 218) â†’ Too low.
* Guess 215 (middle of 212 and 218) â†’ Too high.
* Guess 213 (middle of 212 and 214) â†’ Correct!

***Each guess cuts the range in half, quickly leading to the correct number, 213!***
