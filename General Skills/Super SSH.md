## Soultion 

Pretty straight forward, we use the "ssh" tool to login remotely as ctf-player to titan.picoctf.net at port 53005.
We do this by using the command "ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 53005". Afterwards, it will prompt to accept a fingerprint where you will say "yes". The password is given from the Challenge when you launch the instance. 

**Flag**: picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_5d09a462}
